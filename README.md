# Kumparan Social Media App
This project was made as the technical test for the ReactJS Web Developer internship position.
This project will focus on developing a website by utilizing ReactJS where the website will show the posts information that has been stored on the given API. Other than showing the posts, some other pages will also be developed to complete the functionality of the projects to simulate a social media.

**Creator:** Alesandro Michael Ferdinand

## IMPORTANT
The website is not that responsive at this moment thus it is recommended to open the website on larger device (e.g. Laptop, Monitor).

## Deployed Website

## Design and Brainstorming
Before writing the codes, the interface design of the website must be ready in advance thus it will help the programming stage to be easier and faster with the help of the clear documentation. By that, below is the link that the creator used in writing down the ideas that had been gathered during the brainstorming phase along with the UI design of the website.

## Things Completed

1. Used Atomic Design approach
2. Did some unit testing
3. Used Tailwind for styling
4. Used Redux (state management)
5. List posts from all user page (+ count number of comments for each post)
6. Showed the detail of the post on click
7. On post author username or account click, showed the profile page with the list of albums
8. Click one of the shown albums, the website will show all the photos inside of that album
9. Larger perspective of the image can be viewed by clicking the photos shown after choosing an album to be viewed


## Further Improvements
In order to make sure that the project can achieve its MVP state, some features or possible improvements might be skipped. Regardless the facts that those features were skipped due to their insignificancy to the project, the features are still worthy to be noted down for further improvement in the future. Below is listed the list of possible further improvements.

1. Integration Efficiency (Some data were pulled on a mass scale, some API integrations can be made to be more efficient)
2. Do more unit testing to make sure that the program fulfilled the standards
3. Responsiveness of the website
4. Code Refactorization for neater codes while increasing the reusability of the codes
5. Do carousel or slideshow to show the other thumbnails for each album (increasing interactivity)
6. Add more animations and transitions for interactivity (Some sections are actually clickable but the website has not reflected them well at the moment)
7. Write more documentations as simple as writing comments on the codes
