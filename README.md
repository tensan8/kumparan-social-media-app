# Kumparan Social Media App
This project was made as the technical test for the ReactJS Web Developer internship position.
This project will focus on developing a website by utilizing ReactJS where the website will show the posts information that has been stored on the given API. Other than showing the posts, some other pages will also be developed to complete the functionality of the projects to simulate a social media.

**Creator:** Alesandro Michael Ferdinand

## Design and Brainstorming
Before writing the codes, the interface design of the website must be ready in advance thus it will help the programming stage to be easier and faster with the help of the clear documentation. By that, below is the link that the creator used in writing down the ideas that had been gathered during the brainstorming phase along with the UI design of the website.
